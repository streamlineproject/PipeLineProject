    Liftoff
After a great idea that came too me whilst writing simpie bot I began fantesizing the great uses a bot
could have to simplify an operating system. One of those uses is a commandline based package installer.
I first wanted to implement this feature into simpie but because of the nature of this undertaking and its 
size I decided to create a seperate program fully dedicated to operate as a package manager.

    91 the year it was set loose
I started writing a simple terminal based bot that can respond to certain commands. Writing simpie teached
me some very important lessons, and I learned a lot whilst writing that bot. I will now clarify my code
more so that it is easier to read and understand. This will hopefully make it easier to join the project
because reading code from a noobie developer is most of the time pure hell (like decoding an enigma).

The foundation is layed for the pipline. I will make sure that the moment pipe is compiled for windows the first
repos will be added. Yet I'm not sure which game I should start of with first. This will be a very interesting program
to write and I'm looking forward to it.

The pipe terminal can now gues the command that you tried typing just like simpiebot, this is because I'm using
some code from that bot to get the Pipeline started. This will safe a lot of time and keep the project going.

In september 17 1991 Linux Torvald released The free and open-source operating system Linux.
I dedicate my 91 lines of code too him.
